virtual memory 

solves
- not enough memory (in ram)
- memory fragmentation (enough total memory, but it is split)
- memory corruption and overlapping of multiple apps

virtual memory == each process has its own address space
  == maps the process adress to physical address
    - that can be ram/swap
    - page table returns the physical map of virtual memory

swap-disk == additional memory when needed
- page fault - exception: not found in ram -> search on disk by os

- last 12 bits of an adress are called offset of the page
- each program has a page table: virtual page number => ppn

cache through tlb - store the page translation

- proces == program care ruleaza

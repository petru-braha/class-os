sem vs mutex

- increment == unlock

- mutex is owned by a thread - no one else can unlock it
- while any other process can increment the semaphore 

- mutex can decrement only once
- while the sem can do it countless

- sem must be named or placed inside of a memory mapping
- in order for multiple processes to be able to accept it
